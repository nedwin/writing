I’ve worn a lot of different hats in my professional career. Mostly [figuratively](https://medium.com/@nedwin/19-things-ive-done-28bf47fc3165), but also [literally](https://pretendstore.co/products/spreadsheets-hat).

As an [enthusiast](https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7), someone with [range](https://www.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484), it’s easy to find the things I can do well, it's harder to find the things I should be truly great at.

I’ve worn many [so](https://cieleathletics.com/) [many](https://www.etsy.com/listing/464741299/waynes-world-embroidered-cotton-twill-tv?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=waynes+world+hat&ref=sr_gallery-1-1&frs=1&bes=1) [hats](https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/bass-pro-shops-mesh-caps?rrec=true). From business development, to sales, marketing, design and product but I still wasn’t clear to me which of these specialities was the right fit.

Ultimately what I realized I was looking for was a Ned-shaped hole.

It’s a special hole that requires a lot of autonomy, that lets me flex across product and sales and marketing and strategy and design; a hole that puts success or failure on my shoulders, and lets me share in the spoils of success. 

For a while I thought that perhaps this Ned shaped hole meant that I couldn’t work for someone else, that I'd have to always make the hole myself, that the shape of the hole makes it difficult to find a hole that shape at another company. 

I no longer think that's true.

But the easiest way to find the best fitting, Ned-shaped hole is to create one from scratch. Coincidentally what I’ve spent the majority of career doing.

I’ve found my latest Ned Shaped Hole. 

Nothing to share yet but once you see it you’ll have the same realization I did: “of course!”
